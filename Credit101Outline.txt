o	Mainly for people with moderate to good credit
o	For those with bad credit 
-	Credit 101 (T Chart)
o	What is a credit score?
?	a number assigned to a person that indicates to lenders their capacity to repay a loan. – Oxford Dictionary
o	How to increase your credit score?
?	Pay off your bills on time
?	Pay at least the minimum payment due on time
?	Payoff past due accounts
?	Pay your loans in a timely manner
?	Review your credit report closely and dispute any errors or activity that is not yours
?	Keep diverse forms of credit
?	Refrain from applying for credit needlessly
?	Avoid derogatory marks (bankruptcy, foreclosure, collections, tax lien, or civil judgement)
?	Keep accounts open
•	Almost 15% of your credit score comes from the length of your credit history & accounts remain on your credit report for 10 years

?	Improve your debit to credit ratio
•	How much money you owe vs. how much credit you have available
?	Ask for good faith adjustments
•	When you look at your credit report you may see just one or two late payments. Maybe these payments were late because of an oversight or because of a one-time financial problem that has since been resolved.
•	In this situation, you might get an automatic boost to your credit score by asking for a "good faith adjustment." Call or write to the creditor, and ask for a courtesy adjustment. If you've been a good customer and only have one or two late payments on your account, many creditors will remove the late payment from your credit report.
